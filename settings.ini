-----NOTE!!-----
Lower SizeX, SizeY -> less pieces
Higher Probability (0 <= Probability <= 1) -> More bombs

***RECOMMENDED***
___ScreenSizeX % SizeX = 0       (ScreenSizeX divided by SizeX remainder 0)
___ScreenSizeY % SizeY = 0       (ScreenSizeY divided by SizeY remainder 0)


-----FORMAT-----

Probability = [Z].[Z]            ----- use '.'  DON'T USE ','
